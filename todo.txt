 --- children's game to learn how to calculate and write words ---

* e.g. a bunch of question's like 4*9 = ? and the user fills in 36
* so a list (JSON probaly) of question: answer
* generate a random question for the list of questions and pass, user gives correct answer we go to the next question


event sourcing
* when user enters an answer an event is created
	=> correct/incorrect and question + answer
	 cache even sourcing in Redis

database
mongodb


* user answered question event
* user answered correctly event (sagas) to go to the next question (fetchnextquestioncommand)

(fetchnextquestioncommand) => fetches next question from repo of questions
	- do not fetch a question that has been fetched before


use Kafka or Azure service bus?

send message to Azure Service Bus on event completions
client picks up Azure Service Bus messages and does something with them
